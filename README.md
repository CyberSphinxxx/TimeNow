# TimeNow

TimeNow is a simple web application that allows users to input a city or country and retrieve the current time for that location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API to fetch geographical coordinates and TimeZoneDB API to fetch the corresponding time based on those coordinates.
